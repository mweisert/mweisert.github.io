Where they had struggled was creating the end to end vision to work toward.  Too often the team had developed high-fidelity approaches and began development without considering how all the design elements would work together. I began the project by researching both with clients and internal users.  We learned about existing pain points and opportunities to enhance the experience.  I translated these into user journeys which aligned the team toward our target audiences and their goals. This client works in an Agile environment, which in the past resulted in 'just in time' designs that were often untested and not considerate of future functionality.  To break this cycle, we created an iterative design approach that broadly defined the product in a low-fidelity wireframe. We used our wireframe to begin testing early and often, both internally and with clients. The feedback we received allowed us to layer on detail as we approached the actual epics and sprints to develop the product.  I also focused on multiple facets of the product at a single time to avoid designing a solution that wasn't modular."),i.default.createElement("h3",null,"Atomic Design System"),i.default.createElement("p",null,"Knowing we were building a modular designing system, we decided to employ an Atomic design approach for our design system.

This differs from how we actually use the web, generally on intuition and scanning visual indicators.
